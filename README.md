# bmo-scraper
### Getting Started
First, install Python 3.9.  Any distribution is fine (official, homebrew, conda, etc.).

From this folder, run the following commands:
```sh
$ pip install virtualenv
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
In the poc folder, either run the BmoScraper.py script as an executable, or interactively run BmoScraper.ipynb to view the results step by step.

### To Do
BMO Examples.xlsx is included in this repo.  The performance of the BmoScraper object could be improved by just iterating once per note.  Further testing with additional notes is needed, and exception handling may need to be built in as development continues.
